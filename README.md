*As part of my internship at CODTECH, I worked on a project where I used Python to get live weather data and show it in the form of graphs. I did the whole task in Visual Studio Code (VS Code). I used the OpenWeatherMap API to get the weather forecast for the next 5 days for a city. Then, I used Python’s requests library to bring that data into my program. I picked out the temperature and humidity from the data and created graphs using Matplotlib and Seaborn. In the end, I made a dashboard with two graphs—one showing the temperature and the other showing the humidity over time. This project helped me learn how to connect to an API, work with data, and show it in a visual way. It was a good learning experience and made me better at using Python.*
